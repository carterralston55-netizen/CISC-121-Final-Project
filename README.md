About: App for implementing Merge sort into an application for visual demonstration and for users
---
Why I chose Merge Sort: This is one of my personal favourite sorts to impliment in code. This sorting algoithm would be great to visualize for users new to coding, wanting to know how this sort works, or just to sort some numbers.

Merge sort works by recursivly splitting the list in half, sorting, then merging back together sorted. The smaller steps of that are easier to code, the UI integration and visual representation will be the more challenging parts and finally polishing the UI to be more personal to my design of it and being overall user-friendly

Merge sort works by splitting a list in half recursivly until the size of the list is 1, then it merges them back into one sorted list. 

My UI simplifies it by asking them for a list of numbers, one they can just paste into the app, to which will follow a fast but understandable animation of the numbers, their values, and then the actual sorting. This not only for the simple functuality but also for learning purposes of how this sorting algorthm works.
